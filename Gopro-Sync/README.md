This tool is to sychronize two different gopro videos by using an impulse noise, usually a clap. The tool uses this clap to trim the videos. 

In this folder, there are two different files.
One is a gopro sychronization tool to be used in the command line, and the other is a jupyter notebook that shows plots for better understanding.

gopro_sync tool usage:
python goprosync.py --left PATH_TO_LEFT_MP4 --right PATH_TO_RIGHT_MP4 --out PATH_TO_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
